# *geppyNN:* A Python framework for Gene Expression Programming for Neural Networks (GEPNN) built on top of *geppy*

*geppy* is a computational framework dedicated to [Gene Expression Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_programming) (GEP),  which is proposed by C. Ferreira  in 2001 [1].  *geppy* is developed in Python 3.

*geppyNN* extends the capabilities
